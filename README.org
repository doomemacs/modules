#+title:    Doom Emacs - Official Modules
#+subtitle: The repository for Doom Emacs' official modules

In the future, this repository will hold Doom's official module library (Doom's
starter kit). Modules here are carefully curated for support with Doom core (and
each other) by Doom's author and core maintainers. Users will be able to pull it
in from their ~doom!~ blocks.

For now, it is simply a placeholder.
